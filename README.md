Link to Soap Scents app https://damp-reef-08648.herokuapp.com/soap/new

The app I created uses the following technologies: HTML CSS Javascript Heroku ExpressJS Node.js Mongoose EJS Mongo DB CSS Grid

Unsolved problems:

placement of divs determined location - not grid?
disappointed in array processing

doesn't seem to be working
Can't figure out how to default to /soap
some CSS formatting
footer grows and throws off other ratio sections
fonts not the same on delete buttons
Wish List:

models on index page
home made lye calculator made with JavaScript
pre-filled default values in new soap page
select true or false buttons
blog
links to stores for ingredients to make money
how to videos of me making the recipes
sign in/up logic
additional fields!!! aka array!
link to another database with all products/costs to produce soap
% oil field next to ounces
mold size field
Wanted to do but didn't get to:

buy buttons
large text field for notes field
hover effects of buttons/input fields
table on new page
Problem:

I have made some soap recipes and have them printed out.
I would like to be able to store them digitally and uniformly.
General Purpose:

Allow people to view, create new, edit and delete my soap recipes.
Who would use this app:

People that make cold process soap.
My application uses the 7 restful routes and full CRUD utilizing soap as its database.

Extras:

used header and footer ejs partials
used css grid
used google maps
used social icons
used a table for editing
