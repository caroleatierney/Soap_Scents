## by Carole Tierney: [github](https://github.com/caroleatierney)

### The app I created uses the following technologies:
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] Javascript
- [x] ExpressJS
- [x] Node.js
- [x] Mongoose
- [x] EJS
- [x] Mongo DB
- [x] CSS Grid
- [x] Full CRUD
- [x] 7 RESTful Routes

### Unsolved problems:
* placement of divs determined location - not grid?
* disappointed in array processing
* some CSS formatting
* footer grows and throws off other ratio sections
* fonts not the same on delete buttons

### Wish List:
* models on index page
* home made lye calculator made with JavaScript

* user authentication
* users can store their own data based on authentication

* pre-filled default values in new soap page
* select true or false buttons
* blog

* links to stores for ingredients to make money

* how to videos of me making the recipes
* additional fields!!! aka array!

* link to another database with all products/costs to produce soap
* % oil field next to ounces
* mold size field

## Wanted to do but didn't get to:
* buy buttons
* large text field for notes field
* hover effects of buttons/input fields
* table on new page
